# How to run

To generate the desired output, follow these steps:
1. Place `rev_Yelp` and `business.py` in the same folder and run the script. The resulting output should include a k-means graph.
2. Place `rev_Yelp` and `feature.py` in the same folder. Determine which dataframe you need to use and drop any non-numerical features in that dataframe. Then replace all dataframe names in the code. The result output should include a feature importance bar chart.
